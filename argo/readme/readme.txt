Update Statistics Number Settings
- To change the statistics numbers find the /* Counter */ section and update the data-purecounter-end="" attribute
- You can also set the speed of each counter with data-purecounter-duration="3"
- The count speed can be adjusted to have all counters finish almost at the same time
- If you give bigger numbers less time to be counted to then they will finish close the the smaller ones
